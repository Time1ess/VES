/**
 * This is the main behaviour, where most available API
 * should be found. This object knows the head (VROneSDKHead),
 * which knows its to eyes (VROneSDKEye).
 * 
 * ## Singleton
 * Any public paramter required for the VROneSDK components
 * should be passed through this behaviour.
 * This behaviour can easily be accessed via
 * 
 * 		VROneSDK vrOneSDK = VROneSDK.sharedInstance;
 * 
 * ## Interpupillary distance (IPD)
 * The IPD affects the local position of the eyes/cameras 
 * relating to the head in the Unity Scene.
 * One can set the IPD using this singleton via
 * 
 * 		VROneSDK.sharedInstance.IPD = 0.065f;
 * 
 * The default IPD can be accessed via
 * `VROneSDK.VROneSDKDefaultIPD`.
 * 
 * ## Mono-Mode/Stereo-Mode
 * When VROne runs in mono-mode, both eyes/cameras are located
 * at the very same position (IPD = 0). Nevertheless make sure
 * that you set the users IPD correctly, since this
 * will alter the distortion!
 * 
 * Using the stereo-mode both camera position will
 * respect the users IPD and enable the full 3D 
 * user experience.
 * 
 * Enable/disable mono- and stereo-mode via
 * 
 * 		VROneSDK.sharedInstance.runsInStereMode = true;
 * 
 * ## Enable/Disable Distortion 
 * This only has an affect, if isVROneEnabled == true !!!
 * 
 * When Distortion is enabled, the device-specific LUT is loaded
 * and the the LUT Distortion is applied
 * (default LUT for unsupported devices is the Galaxy S5 LUT)
 * 
 * When Distortion is disabled, the device-specific value ImageShift is loaded
 * and the positon of the two camera viewports on the screen is shifted
 * accordingly on the x-axes.
 * (default ImageShift for unsupported devices is the Galaxy S5 ImageShift)
 * 
 * Since there are different screen sizes, this is needed to match
 * the physical distance of the VR One lenses.
 * 
 * 
 * ## Enable/Disable VROne
 * When user hasn't put on the VROne yet, use 
 * 
 * 		VROneSDK.sharedInstance.isVROneEnabled = false;
 * 
 * to disable splitting the view and present a
 * regular screen to the user.
 * Once your game starts set this value to `true` 
 * and thus enable the full VROne experience for
 * the user.
 * 
 * ## Enable/Disable Screen Dimming
 * Use property `neverSleep` to prevent screen dimming
 * during gameplay.
 * 
 * ## Target frame rate
 * Use property `targetFrameRate` to get or set the
 * targetFrameRate for this app.
 * Default targetFrameRate is 60fps.
